------------------

MacOSX and Windows support

Note for Windows users:

Windows usage is supported with some limitations:

-  No colored output.

   -  Currently I have no idea on how to fix this.

-  Some UTF-8 symbols used in output are only with some fonts like
   *DejaVu Sans Mono*.

   -  In future, I will try to implement a version of script that do not
      request UTF-8 support to return results.
